# Windows on CircleCI Preview Docs
Temporary docs on how to use the pre-release preview of Windows jobs on CircleCI.

## Prerequisites to try out Windows on CircleCI

- [ ] Your organization is using a [performance plan](https://circleci.com/pricing/usage/)
- [ ] Your project has [pipelines enabled](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/build-processing/)

## Please Read This Before Proceeding

* Windows support on CircleCI is currently *in the preview phase*. This is *not* production-ready software. Please do not rely on the Windows support for your production needs right now.
* As this is preview software, some product functionality has not yet been implemented. Some parts of the product might have bugs.
* The functionality not yet available on Windows includes:
	* the `deploy` step
	* Docker support
	* Workspaces
	* SSH into the job
* You might see increased spin-up times for Windows jobs during the pre-release phase.
* We are not ready to open up Windows support to the wider public yet, so please only use CircleCI for Windows in the *private repos in your org*. Please *do not* use CircleCI for Windows in open source repositories, and please do not share the examples of your Windows config outside your organization.
* Please do not more than 2 Windows jobs concurrently during the preview phase.
* Windows jobs are charged at 40 credits/minute. Please keep in mind that the pricing for Windows jobs can change in the future.

## What are Windows pipelines?
Historically, CircleCI has supported `docker`, `machine`, and `macos` [executors](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#docker--machine--macosexecutor).

With the introduction of our new Windows machine jobs, is now possible to run jobs in your pipelines in a Windows environment.

## Getting started

### Configuration
Once the prerequisite conditions are met, set up a standard `.circleci/config.yml` file and define a Windows executor. The preview orb provides a powershell `shell` by default. 

```
version: 2.1

orbs:
  win: sandbox/windows-tools@dev:preview

jobs:
  windows:
    executor: win/preview-default
      - ...
```

With this executor in place, define the rest of the configuration file to meet the project's needs. For more information on writing a standard CircleCI config, check out our [documentation](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/). 

> A low-effort way to get started is by creating an empty project on CircleCI consisting solely of `.circle/config.yml` file. Copy and commit our `samples/test-harness.yml` file to see a green Windows job in action.

## Questions and discussion
We have a lengthy roadmap in place to port our most-loved features over to support Windows pipelines, and to add additional, Windows-specific features. We welcome your feedback on the existing beta product, and on design requests.

Please discuss Windows design in the Issues section of this repo.

### Frequently asked questions

> What exact version of Windows are you using?

We use Windows Server 2019 Datacenter Edition, the Server Core option.

> What is installed on the machine?

We install Git, Chocolatey, and 7zip. We donâ€™t install any other dependencies at the moment.

If you need other software installed on the Windows machines, please open a GitHub issue and explain what software do you need, which versions of it do you use, and why is it important to you to have this software pre-installed in the machines.

> What is the machine size?

The Windows machines have 4 vCPUs and 15GB RAM.

> Did you implement any I/O optimizations?

Not right now. If there are any specific optimizations in mind that would be useful, please let us know in the GitHub issues.

> Can I use Powershell in my CircleCI config? 

Yes. The `win/preview-default` executor includes Powershell as the default shell. So in [this example](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/windows-preview-docs/blob/master/samples/test-harness.yml#L13), the steps are being run as Powershell commands.
